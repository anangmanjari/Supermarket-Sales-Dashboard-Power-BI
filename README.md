# Supermarket-Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI
I have created a dashboard using supermarket sales data to analyze Total Revenue by different categories like city, product, date, and payment type.

Dashboard has been created considering following details -

1. Added few slicers for date, city, branch, product, customer type, gender, and payment method.
2. Added customized tooltip for each figure to quickly figure out division of revenue.
3. Added customized button for table view at the upper right corner of the dashboard.
4. Created a drill through for product type to show diversification of revenue for a particular product.
